<p>"Layali El Andalus's performance was wonderful and more than just engaging, I'm certain the audience felt as if it was transported to a different place and time."</p>

<p>"Layali El Andalus made a compelling case for the universality of the language of music in their performance at Harding University. Their engaging presentation of musical styles that were unfamiliar to most of the audience won a number of converts and reminded us all that the human experience transcends language. These folks are talented and experienced performers; they're also personable communicators and entertainers."</p>
